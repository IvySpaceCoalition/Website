    <h2 id="making-things-go-fast">Making Things Go Fast</h2>
<p><em>This is an organization for engineers, scientists, and rocketeers from all walks of life.</em> That’s it–not networking or resume building or networking. We’re all interested in making mass go fast and high–the ISC is dedicated to sharing research and projects to further our collective goals.</p>

<h2 id="the-conference">The Conference</h2>

<p>The ISC’s inaugural conference will be an excellent and fun opportunity for students from across the Ivy League schools to meet and build meaningful relationships with peers from the other institutions, learn more about advances in aerospace technology from industry experts, present their projects and research to a broader audience, and network with potential employers.</p>

<h3 id="conference-topics">Conference Topics</h3>

<h4 id="alternative-energy-in-aerospace">Alternative Energy in Aerospace:</h4>
<p>Energy sources for power generation and propulsion in aerospace are rapidly changing in response to the development of new technologies and the need to reduce carbon emissions. In aeronautics, electrified propulsion is likely to become commonplace within the coming decades. New technologies in  electric propulsion as well as power storage and distribution will allow for distributed electrified propulsion in commercial aircraft improving efficiency as well as reducing the cost to fly, both economically and environmentally. In space, solar power and electric propulsion are allowing spacecraft to go farther with less fuel and nuclear fission and fusion hold the promise of allowing humans to become an interplanetary species; serious challenges remain: can nuclear power be safely launched and used in space? When will fusion become a practical reality? This track will cover these topics and focus on how new forms of energy will coexist with and eventually replace current chemical power generation technologies.</p>

<h4 id="space-technology">Space technology:</h4>
<p>This track focuses on advancements in science and engineering that impact the development of the aerospace industry. Some of these technologies include asteroid mining, ion propulsion, human factors, and light arc. (Asteroid mining) Asteroids are being mined for their rich source of natural resources that can be either utilized in space or taken back to Earth. The different applications of asteroid mining continue to be posed. The commercialization of the aerospace industry and the rise of private over public space programs will prove to have an unknown impact the development of this technology. (Ion Propulsion) Ion thrusters use electron bombardment to produce a highly energetic plasma. Ion thrusters are being applied alongside developing technology in order to build new systems like the Dawn spacecraft. What are other commercial applications of ion propulsion? What are the benefits of ionization over other forms of propulsion? (Human factors) An understanding of how flight systems interact with a pilot will allow for safer and more efficient aerospace travel. This can be used to combat fatigue or random error. In the modern age of the privatization of the aerospace industry, the reality of space tourism and space colonization is emerging. This is sure to have a significant impact on society.</p>

<h4 id="reusability">Reusability:</h4>
<p>Reusability is becoming an increasingly essential component of innovation in space exploration and research. Reusable rockets and air-launch platforms are facilitating inexpensive and frequent access to low Earth Orbit. Three-dimensional printing capabilities have launched development to a new level, creating new opportunities to manufacture products in space. The emerging ability to mine resources in space begs questions regarding the future of in space propulsion, space infrastructure, and commercial business opportunities, as well as their implications on deep space exploration. While reusability makes access to space more readily available, it is also important to consider the limits and challenges posed by accessibility. Will regulatory processes that govern accessibility facilitated by reusability become more rigorous? What sort of consequences might commercial business opportunities have on space development? What are the most pressing technical challenges we face? Among so many others, these questions will become essential to understanding how society can take advantage of utilizing reusability in space.</p>

<h4 id="exploration">Exploration:</h4>
<p>Despite a shift towards commercialization, exploration remains a significant driver in space development; there are many avenues, new and old for exploring the cosmos. Observation from afar using telescopes will continue to be a major method, especially with the launch of the James Webb Space telescope, but what discoveries are on the horizon? Will we discover planets capable of sustaining life? For our nearer astronomical neighbors, robotic explorers, will go where humans can’t, but crewed exploration is on the cusp of a revolution. Multiple countries are pursuing a return to the moon, and it seems unlikely humans will fail to reach Mars by 2050. Perhaps, even permanent settlements will be established on extraterrestrial bodies during our lifetimes. Even extrasolar exploration may be possible in the form of Project Breakthrough Starshot. Is this the century humanity becomes a truly interplanetary species?</p>
